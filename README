coursera-scrape
By Sean Yeh

Just a simple ruby script made for myself to download all the video lectures of my classes on
www.coursera.org. Feel free to modify it for your own needs.

Dependencies:
watir-webdriver ruby gem
chromedriver (download/install from
http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver)
aria2 (or wget)

Has only been tested on Mac OS X, but should work easily with other systems
with minor changes.

Other notes:
If your aria2 is not compiled with SSL support, it may complain about
authentication problems.
