coursera-scrape
By Sean Yeh

Just a simple ruby script made for myself to download all the video lectures of my classes on www.coursera.org. Feel free to modify it for your own needs.

Dependencies:
watir-webdriver ruby gem
Google chrome 
chromedriver (download/install from http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver)
aria2 (or wget)

Instead of using Chrome (and chromedriver) it is possible to use other browsers
as well. See http://watirwebdriver.com for more information on the other
browsers watir-webdriver supports. You will probably
have to modify the coursera-scrape source a little.

Has only been tested on Mac OS X, but should work easily with other systems
with minor changes.

Other notes:
If your aria2 is not compiled with SSL support, it may complain about
authentication problems.
